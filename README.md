# Sentiment Analysis - User Tweets
### General Idea: 
####Create an inerface in which users can do a sentiment analysis on twitter users of their choice.
### Implementation: 
####Using Twitter's API to scrape user data (tweets, retweets, etc.), read in the text (filter), and apply natural language processing to do a sentiment analysis (how positive, negative, etc. is the content).
