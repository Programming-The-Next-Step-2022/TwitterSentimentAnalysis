# TwitterWorldMap
# General Idea: Create an interactive World Map where users receive information about countries specific Twitter activities (e.g., most retweeted Tweets, trending topics, most liked comments).
# Design: World Map that enables users to click on single countries (maybe just continents). Countries/Continents are highlighted after clicking on them opening a new information dahsboard showing the information in 2-3 columns.
# Implementation: Using Twitter's location data (tweet or account location) to match geographical coordinates with world map coordinates
